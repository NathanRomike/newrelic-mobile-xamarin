New Relic Agent
==========

This is a MonoTouch binding for the New Relic Agent SDK which can be found at

     https://newrelic.com/docs/mobile-apps/ios-installation-and-configuration

The current version of this binding is for New Relic Agent SDK 1.376

Building
========

1. Run `make` in the binding directory to build NewRelic.dll

Using NewRelic.dll with your own iOS App
==========================================

Simply add NewRelic.dll to your project's References in MonoDevelop and you
are good to go!

This works much better with MonoTouch. Because it doesn't override the Build-in (.NET) Error handling.
